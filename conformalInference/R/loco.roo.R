#' Variable importance via excess test error
#'
#' Compute prediction intervals for the excess test error due to dropping a
#'   variable, measured in-sample and having valid in-sample coverage
#'
#' @param x Matrix of variables, of dimension (say) n x p.
#' @param y Vector of responses, of length (say) n.
#' @param train.fun A function to perform model training, i.e., to produce an
#'   estimator of E(Y|X), the conditional expectation of the response variable
#'   Y given features X. Its input arguments should be x: matrix of features,
#'   and y: vector of responses.
#' @param predict.fun A function to perform prediction for the (mean of the)
#'   responses at new feature values. Its input arguments should be out: output
#'   produced by train.fun, and newx: feature values at which we want to make
#'   predictions.
#' @param vars A list specifying the variables (indices between 1 and p) to
#'   for which variable importance should be investigated. Alternatively, if
#'   set equal to 0, the default, then all variables are investigated.
#' @param alpha Miscoverage level for the prediction intervals, i.e., intervals
#'   with coverage 1-alpha are formed. Default for alpha is 0.1.
#' @param mad.train.fun A function to perform training on the absolute residuals
#'   i.e., to produce an estimator of E(R|X) where R is the absolute residual
#'   R = |Y - m(X)|, and m denotes the estimator produced by train.fun.
#'   This is used to scale the conformal score, to produce a prediction interval
#'   with varying local width. The input arguments to mad.train.fun should be
#'   x: matrix of features, and y: vector of absolute residuals. The default for
#'   mad.train.fun is NULL, which means that no training is done on the absolute
#'   residuals, and the usual (unscaled) conformal score is used. Note that if
#'   mad.train.fun is non-NULL, then so must be mad.predict.fun (see next).
#' @param mad.predict.fun A function to perform prediction for the (mean of the)
#'   absolute residuals at new feature values. Its input arguments should be
#'   out: output produced by mad.train.fun, and newx: feature values at which we
#'   want to make predictions. The default for mad.predict.fun is NULL, which
#'   means that no local scaling is done for the conformal score, i.e., the
#'   usual (unscaled) conformal score is used.
#' @param split Indices that define the data-split to be used (i.e., the indices
#'   define the first half of the data-split). Note that this split is common
#'   both to conformal.pred.roo (whether already run, or to be run internally,
#'   see below) and the excess error intervals computed by this function.
#'   Default is NULL, in which case the split is chosen randomly.
#' @param seed Integer to be passed to set.seed before defining the random 
#'   data-split to be used. Default is NULL, which effectively sets no seed.
#'   If both split and seed are passed, the former takes priority and the latter
#'   is ignored.
#' @param out.roo Output from running conformal.pred.roo on the given data set;
#'   default is NULL, which means that conformal.pred.roo will be run internally
#'   in order to compute in-sample prediction intervals. If out.roo is NULL,
#'   then the data-split common to conformal.pred.roo and this function will be
#'   determined by the split or seed arguments. If non-NULL, then the common
#'   data-split will be determined by that recorded in out.roo, and the split
#'   and seed arguments will be (silently) ignored.
#' @param verbose Should intermediate progress be printed out? Default is FALSE.
#'
#' @return A list with the following components: lo, up, vars, split,
#'   out.roo. The third component is a list of variables that were tested (i.e.,
#'   dropped one at a time, to compute excess error). The first two are arrays
#    of dimension n x length(vars) x m.
#'   The indices used for the half of the data-split are
#'   returned in split. Finally, for convenience, the output from running
#'   conformal.pred.roo is stored in out.roo.
#'
#' @details For concreteness, suppose that we want to use the predictions from
#'   forward stepwise regression at steps 1 through 5 in the path. In this case,
#'   there are m = 5 internal tuning parameter values to predict.fun, in the
#'   notation used above, and each of the returned matrices pred, lo, up, fit
#'   will have 5 columns (one for each step of the forward stepwise path).
#'   The code is structured in this way so that we may defined a single pair of
#'   functions train.fun and predict.fun, over a set of m = 5 tuning parameter
#'   values, instead of calling the conformal function separately m = 5 times.

#' Variable importance (local) via excess test error, extended to right-
#' censored data
#' 
#' Compute prediction intervals for the excess test error due to dropping a
#'   variable, measured in-sample and having asymptotically valid in-sample 
#'   coverage. Extension to estimators of the restricted mean survival time with 
#'   right-censored data.
#'
#' @param x Matrix of variables, of dimension (say) n x p.
#' @param t Vector of responses (observed times), of length (say) n.
#' @param d Vector of responses (censoring indicator), of length (say) n.
#' @param tau Horizon of time.
#' @param train.fun A function to perform model training, i.e., to produce an
#'   estimator of E(min(T*,tau)|X), the conditional expectation of the true 
#'   event time T* given features X. Its input arguments should be x: matrix of 
#'   features, t: vector of observed times, d: vector of censoring indicators
#'   and tau: horizon of time. train.fun can be a function performing model 
#'   training for several (say m) regression models.
#' @param predict.fun A function to perform prediction for the (mean of the)
#'   responses at new feature values. Its input arguments should be out: output
#'   produced by train.fun, and newx: feature values at which we want to make
#'   predictions.
#' @param w Censoring weights. This should be a vector of length n. Default is 
#'   NULL, in which case censoring weights are computed using the censoring 
#'   model specified by the parameter cens.model, or by default with the 
#'   Kaplan-Meier model. 
#' @param cens.model Model used to estimate the censoring survival function.
#'   This should be equal to "km", "rsf" or "cox" (respectively Kaplan-Meier, 
#'   Random Survival Forests or Cox). Default is "km". 
#' @param vars A list specifying the variables (indices between 1 and p)
#'   for which variable importance should be investigated. Alternatively, if
#'   set equal to 0, the default, then all variables are investigated.
#' @param alpha Miscoverage level for the prediction intervals, i.e., intervals
#'   with coverage 1-alpha are formed. Default for alpha is 0.1.
#' @param mad.train.fun A function to perform training on the observed absolute 
#'   residuals R = |min(T,tau) - m(X)| and their associated censoring weights,  
#'   where m denotes the estimator produced by train.fun, to estimate E(R*|X)
#'   for the true absolute residual denoted R*.
#'   This is used to scale the conformal score, to produce a prediction interval
#'   with varying local width. The input arguments to mad.train.fun should be
#'   x: matrix of features, y: vector of observed absolute residuals, and w: 
#'   censoring weights. The default for mad.train.fun is NULL, which means that 
#'   no training is done on the absolute residuals, and the usual (unscaled) 
#'   conformal score is used. Note that if mad.train.fun is non-NULL, then so 
#'   must be mad.predict.fun (see next).
#' @param mad.predict.fun A function to perform prediction for the (mean of the)
#'   absolute residuals at new feature values. Its input arguments should be
#'   out: output produced by mad.train.fun, and newx: feature values at which we
#'   want to make predictions. The default for mad.predict.fun is NULL, which
#'   means that no local scaling is done for the conformal score, i.e., the
#'   usual (unscaled) conformal score is used.
#' @param split Indices that define the data-split to be used (i.e., the indices
#'   define the first half of the data-split). Note that this split is common
#'   both to conformal.pred.roo.surv (whether already run, or to be run inter-
#'   nally, see below) and the excess error intervals computed by this function.
#'   Default is NULL, in which case the split is chosen randomly.
#' @param seed Integer to be passed to set.seed before defining the random 
#'   data-split to be used. Default is NULL, which effectively sets no seed.
#'   If both split and seed are passed, the former takes priority and the latter
#'   is ignored.
#' @param out.roo.surv Output from running conformal.pred.roo.surv on the given  
#'   data set; default is NULL, which means that conformal.pred.roo.surv will be  
#'   run internally in order to compute in-sample prediction intervals. If  
#'   is NULL, then the data-split common to conformal.pred.roo.surv and this 
#'   out.roo.surv function will be determined by the split or seed arguments. If  
#'   non-NULL, then the common data-split will be determined by that recorded in  
#'   out.roo.surv, and the split and seed arguments will be (silently) ignored.
