#' Full Conformal quantile regression prediction intervals.
#'
#' Compute prediction intervals using conformal quantile inference with Random Forest.
#'
#' @param x Matrix of features, of dimension (say) n x p.
#' @param y Vector of responses, of length (say) n.
#' @param x0 Matrix of features, each row being a point at which we want to
#'   form a prediction interval, of dimension (say) n0 x p. 
#' @param method Choose the method to compute the confidence intervals. 
#' The options are "classic" , without local scaling of the intervals, "median",
#' using the median instead of the pointwise evaluations (y), or "scaled", with
#' local scaling. Default is "scaled".
#' @param nthreads Set the number of threads to use (for parallel computation)
#' in the function quantregForest. Default is 8.
#' @param alpha Miscoverage level for the prediction intervals, i.e., intervals
#' with coverage 1-alpha are formed. Default for alpha is 0.1.
#' @param gamma Hyperparameter which defines the quantile levels used in the
#' method. Default is alpha/2.
#' @param split Indices that define the data-split to be used (i.e., the indices
#'   define the first half of the data-split, on which the model is trained).
#'   Default is NULL, in which case the split is chosen randomly.
#' @param seed Integer to be passed to set.seed before defining the random 
#'   data-split to be used. Default is NULL, which effectively sets no seed.
#'   If both split and seed are passed, the former takes priority and the latter
#'   is ignored.
#' @param verbose Should intermediate progress be printed out? Default is FALSE.
#' @param w Weights, in the case of covariate shift. This should be a vector of
#'   length n+n0, giving the weights (i.e., ratio of test to training feature
#'   densities), at each of n+n0 the training and test points. Default is NULL,
#'   which means that we take all weights to be 1.
#' @param mad.train.fun A function to perform training on the absolute residuals
#'   i.e., to produce an estimator of E(R|X) where R is the absolute residual
#'   R = |Y - m(X)|, and m denotes the estimator produced by train.fun.
#'   This is used to scale the conformal score, to produce a prediction interval
#'   with varying local width. The input arguments to mad.train.fun should be
#'   x: matrix of features, y: vector of absolute residuals, and out: the output
#'   produced by a previous call to mad.train.fun, at the \emph{same} features
#'   x. The function mad.train.fun may (optionally) leverage this returned
#'   output for efficiency purposes. See details below. The default for 
#'   mad.train.fun is NULL, which means that no training is done on the absolute
#'   residuals, and the usual (unscaled) conformal score is used. Note that if
#'   mad.train.fun is non-NULL, then so must be mad.predict.fun (next).
#' @param mad.predict.fun A function to perform prediction for the (mean of the)
#'   absolute residuals at new feature values. Its input arguments should be
#'   out: output produced by mad.train.fun, and newx: feature values at which we
#'   want to make predictions. The default for mad.predict.fun is NULL, which
#'   means that no local scaling is done for the conformal score, i.e., the
#'   usual (unscaled) conformal score is used.
#' @param num.grid.pts Number of grid points used when forming the conformal
#'   intervals (each grid point is a trial value for the interval). Default is
#'   100.
#' @param grid.factor Expansion factor used to define the grid for the conformal
#'   intervals, i.e., the grid points are taken to be equally spaced in between
#'   -grid.factor*max(abs(y)) and grid.factor*max(abs(y)). Default is 1.25. In
#'   this case (and with exchangeable data, thus unity weights) the restriction
#'   of the trial values to this range costs at most 1/(n+1) in coverage. See
#'   details below.
#'
#' @return A list with the following components: lo, up,i.e.two 
#'  vectors of length n0, while split contains the training indices.
#' 
#' @details This function is based on the package \code{\link{quantregForest}} to
#'  compute the Quantile Regression. 
#'  If this package is not installed, then the function will abort.
#'  
#' @details Since the computation can be quite long, we exploited the package
#' \code{\link{pbapply}} to provide progress bar for loops. If this package 
#' is not installed, then the classical apply function will be used.
#'
#' @details The function may create invalid confidence intervals 
#' (this problem is described in the Sesia, Candès reference paper and occurs when the
#' selected method is "classic"). If this happens, an error is displayed suggesting 
#' to fine-tune the value of the hyperparameter gamma or to change the input method.
#'
#' @references The quantile nonconformity measures are taken fom  "A comparison of 
#' some conformal quantile regression methods" 
#' by Sesia, Candés (2020).
#' Moreover the "classic","median" and "scaled" methods are respectively taken from
#' "Conformalized quantile regression" by Romano, Patterson, Candès (2019), from the
#' previous Sesia, Candès paper and from "A (tight) upper bound for the length of
#' confidence intervals with conditional coverage" by Kivaranovic, Leeb (2020).
