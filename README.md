# Conformal Inference R Project
## Maintained by Ryan Tibshirani
### Based on work by Rina Barber, Emmanuel Candes, Max G'Sell, Jing Lei, Aaditya Ramdas, Alessandro Rinaldo, Ryan Tibshirani, Larry Wasserman

This repository contains R software tools for conformal inference. The current
emphasis is on conformal prediction in regression. We may eventually add tools
for density estimation and classification.

The folder "conformalInference" can be installed as an R package, providing
access to the software tools, and the file "conformalInference.pdf" contains 
documentation. 

The folder "lei2018" contains R code to reproduce all examples in the paper
[Distribution-Free Predictive Inference for Regression](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/papers/conformal.pdf)
by Lei, G'Sell, Rinaldo, Tibshirani, Wasserman (2018).  The folder
"tibshirani2019" contains R code to reproduce all examples in the paper
[Conformal Prediction Under Covariate Shift](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/papers/weightedcp.pdf)
by Tibshirani, Barber, Candes, Ramdas (2019). The folder "cwiling2023"
contains R code to reproduce all examples in the paper
[A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Time to Event 
Predictions using the Restricted Mean Survival Time](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.16075.pdf)
by Cwiling, Perduca, Bouaziz (2023). This code all relies on the
"conformalInference" R package.
